# class-attendance

**Allows instructors to manage attendance and lunch count on a touch interface.**

Each student in a list is able to select hot, cold, or bag lunch. 
Each student defaults to absent, so if they enter nothing, they are considered absent.

**How to edit student list**

Find the `class.json` file located in the same directory as the `class-attendance.exe` application. 
Make sure to keep the JSON formatting shown in the example file.
