# class-attendance

**Allows instructors to manage attendance and lunch count on a touch interface.**

Each student in a list is able to select hot, cold, or bag lunch. 
Each student defaults to absent, so if they enter nothing, they are considered absent.

**How to edit student list**

Find the `class.json` file located in the same directory as the `class-attendance.exe` application. 
Open `class.json` in a text editor like Notepad and save after you make changes.
Make sure to keep the JSON formatting shown in the example file. (Square brackets around the whole list, double quotes around each name, commas between each name.)
